EJScreen is the environmental justice screening and mapping tool that utilizes standard and nationally consistent data to highlight places that may have higher environmental burdens and vulnerable populations.

This is an unofficial copy of EJScreen, hosted by the [Public Environmental Data Partners](https://screening-tools.com/). Some links and text may incorrectly suggest that this site is affiliated with the US Government. We've published an initial reconstruction - you can identify the EJScreen data and index percentiles for a given block group right now. Check back soon as we put more time and resources toward the functionality of EJScreen you might be used to. Thanks for your patience and support.
